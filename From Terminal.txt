//Git authentication methods (further reading required)
To connect your computer with GitLab, you need to add your credentials to identify yourself. You have two options:

Authenticate through SSH once and GitLab won’t ask your credentials every time you pull, push, and clone.

    On your computer, open the terminal in the directory you’ve initialized, paste the command you copied, and press enter:

            git remote add origin https://github.com:username/projectpath.git
